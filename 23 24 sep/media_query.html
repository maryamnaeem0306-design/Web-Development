            Spatial Modeling and Prediction of Urban Air Pollution Using Geostatistical and Machine Learning Approaches
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p>Background: Rapid urbanization in developing countries has led to increased air pollution, but traditional monitoring stations are sparse.

Objectives: To integrate spatial statistics (kriging, IDW) with machine learning (random forest, XGBoost) for accurate prediction of air pollutants in urban areas.

Novelty: Combines geostatistical interpolation with ML to improve prediction accuracy.

Methods: Collect secondary data on PM2.5, NO2, SO2; apply spatial autocorrelation tests, kriging, and machine learning; validate using RMSE and MAE.</p>

        <h1>Workplace Harassment and Its Psychological Consequences: A Multilevel Statistical Analysis Details</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Background: Workplace harassment is linked to stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, but studies often ignore hierarchical structures (employees within organizations).

Objectives: To investigate how workplace harassment influences depressive symptoms while accounting for individual and organizational-level factors.

Novelty: Applies multilevel modeling to separate personal vs organizational impact.

Methods: Survey data collection, factor analysis for harassment indicators, Mann-Whitney U tests for group comparisons, multilevel logistic regression for depressive outcomes.</p>

        <h1>Assessing and Forecasting Water Quality Dynamics in Punjab: A Comparative Analysis of Lockdown and Post-Lockdown Periods</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Background: COVID-19 lockdowns reduced industrial and transport activities, offering a natural experiment for environmental recovery.

Objectives: To compare pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown water quality indicators across Punjab.

Novelty: First comparative study in Pakistan focusing on lockdown as an intervention in water quality improvement.

Methods: Collect water quality data (pH, TDS, WQI, heavy metals); descriptive analysis (mean, SD), Pearson correlation, factor analysis, multiple linear regression; spatial mapping using GIS.</p>

        <h1>
            Statistical Modeling of Ratio-Type Estimators Using Auxiliary Information in Survey Sampling
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p>Background: Ratio estimators are widely used in survey sampling for improved precision, but their bias and efficiency need deeper exploration when auxiliary variables involve variance.

Objectives: To develop new ratio-type estimators using sample variance of auxiliary variables and derive their distributional properties.

Novelty: Theoretical contribution in sampling theory with potential applications in socio-economic surveys.

Methods: Use Taylor expansion for bias/variance derivation, derive MSE, compare efficiency with existing estimators, perform simulation studies in R.</p>
